    <h1>Physical Health</h1>
    <p>Physical health focuses on the state of the human body and how it operates.</p>
    <h2>Group Fitness Classes</h2>
    <p>According to the University of Pittsburgh’s Student Affairs website, “becoming healthier involves adopting healthy habits. This includes incorporating physical activity into daily life.” Therefore, the University of Pittsburgh has organized a variety of high and low impact fitness classes to help students reach their goals.</p>

    <h2>Intramural Sports</h2>
    <p>In addition to group fitness classes, the University has organized an intramural sports league to incorporate physical activity in a fun and social way. According to the University of Pittsburgh’s Student Affairs website, “the Department of Campus Recreation offers a variety of intramural sports for undergraduate and graduate students, faculty and staff to maintain their competitive edge, remain active, or simply meet new people.” This is a great option for people who are interested in pursuing a sport, but do not have the time to commit to a club team. </p>
