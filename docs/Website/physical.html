    <h2>Intramural Sports</h2>
    <p>In addition to group fitness classes, the University has organized an intramural sports league to incorporate physical activity in a fun and social way. According to the University of Pittburgh’s Student Affairs website, “the Department of Campus Recreation offers a variety of intramural sports for undergraduate and graduate students, faculty and staff to maintain their competitive edge, remain active, or simply meet new people.” This is a great option for people who are interested in pursuing a sport, but do not have the time to commit to a club team.
