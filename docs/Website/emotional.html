        <h2>Stress Free Zone </h2>
        <p>According to the University of Pittsburgh’s Student Affairs website, “The Stress Free Zone (SFZ) is a space where students can learn and regularly practice evidence-based, mind/body stress reduction skills.” Stress can manifest itself in different ways in both the mind and body. The SFZ is determined to share tips and tricks for working with the mind/body system. They hope to not just make students feel better in the moment, but to help them develop mindfulness habits that they will use going forward. Students can participate via walk-in services, regularly scheduled classes, and special workshops on topics ranging from meditation practices to chiropractic care for stress.</p>
