    <h2>University Counseling Center</h2>
    <p>The Counseling Center provides free access to mental health specialists for all students in the University community. While not a replacement for mental health care covered by your insurance, the counseling center can provide services for students—including assessment, counseling and psychotherapy (individual, group, and couples), and psychiatry—on a short-term basis in addition to offering acute care and crisis intervention. </p>

    <h2>Stress Free Zone </h2>
    <p>At the Stress Free Zone, graduate students can learn and regularly practice evidence-based mind/body stress-reduction skills. These skills are primarily taught through mindfulness meditation, a form of attention training that involves an intentional, nonjudgmental observation of the present moment. Students can participate via walk-in services, regularly scheduled classes, and special workshops on topics ranging from meditation practices to chiropractic care for stress.</p>

    <h3>American Foundation for Suicide Prevention</h3>
    <p>The Western Pennsylvania chapter of the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention (AFSP) covers 20 counties. AFSP does not provide mental health or crisis services.
